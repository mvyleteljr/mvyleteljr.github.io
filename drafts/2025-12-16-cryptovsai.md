# Introduction
* Coming from crypto
* Introduces the parallels


It'




centralizing vs decentralizing force
fear vs fun drivers
power centers
NO ONE IS HAVING FUN
ITs multidisciplinary / philosophical 
but it's not being expressed well
crypto is empowering
ai is fundamentally disempowering 
* vibe coding is a caveat
* at their extremes
in crypto, you assume a theology of the users
in ai, safety vs not safety is the only one, you can easily live outside
digital nihilism
* connect to the bored apes and the AI slop*
* actively aggressive --> past nihilsm?
* started with social media
	* The first modern transparently negative effects that were particularly long lasting
crypto was the tech of the future before AI

AI is not internet native -- it doesnt' feel like internet native (how we grew up with the internet)
* so distinctly modern in its internet nativeness
	* divorced from internet principlies
	* talk about how it's trained on the exponential growth (dominates all data created before the modern age)*
