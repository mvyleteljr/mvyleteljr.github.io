# The Chalamet Schism

I've become increasingly convinced that there exists a widening chasm in the current zeitgeist. 

In the east -- the old world -- dopamine addiction and late stage capitalism are wreaking havoc on all generations. Short-form media is melting brains, people are betting the house in prediction markets and on memecoins, and health is deteriorating.

In the west, there is a revolution. 

There is some overlap between the halves, 

1. Fracture
	1. Steady pursuit of excellence over decades
	2. Substance
	3. Short form 

The middle doesn't exist
collective cultural consciousness is not fragmented by subcommunity. 

## Permanent Overclass

If you're in a good spot right now, it's self-sustaining
If you're not, it's self-destructive

## Shared Culture / Flattening

## Revolt

## Plans and Questions

As this is part of my daily blog series and I have a limited amount of time today, I'd like to use the remaining bit to describe an initial plan for going at this and the sets of questions that most enthrall me about this problem. 

### Step 1 - *Define* the End-State

Goal: Create a set of proxy tasks such that if an AI could complete them autonomously, we'd be in what I consider to be a meaningful end-state environment for this discussion. 

This gives us a stable "physics" to work within. 
### Step 2 - Kinematics

Goal: Define the important trajectories we want to map and how to define them.

Put plainly, if we have an agreed upon set of end-state capabilities, we need to define the industries/sectors/areas/ideas that we want to try unfolding under this physics.

Some candidates: public markets, resource ownership, human power dynamics, art, etc... 

### Step 3 - On Meaning/Identity

I think the core of this discussion (the elephant inside of the elephant) is going to break down to a question of *meaning*, so I'll have to spend some time on it. 

That's obviously a big one. I'll need to scope it

There are a lot of ways to cut this all up. Some potential lenses:
* "End-state is 0 necessary friction between idea and execution - explore *friction* as a meaning maker". 
* "End-state is never doing anything you don't want to do - explore *suffering* as a meaning maker". 
* "End-state is that all questions are answerable via inference - explore *exploration* and curiosity as a meaning maker"

I'm not sure... A bit at sea with this one, which makes sense given I'm asking a 10,000 year old question here. 

## Conclusion

My goal is simple: to have a vision for the future worth running towards that is equally vivid as the one we're running from. 

Some questions: 
1. What happens to the instinctive drive to create power dynamics in society?
2. What happens to social mobility?
	1. Permanent underclass? Real or fake! Who knows!
3. What happens to art without friction? 
	1. Where do our creative impulses come from?
4. Spirituality?
	1. Does religious practice increase? 
5. Access to AI?
6. What happens to finance and currency generally?
	1. Will there be any human participants in markets? 
7.
