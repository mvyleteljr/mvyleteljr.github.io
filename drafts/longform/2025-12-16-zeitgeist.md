# The Chalamet Schism

I've become increasingly convinced that there exists a widening chasm in the current zeitgeist. 

In the east -- the old world -- dopamine addiction and late stage capitalism are wreaking havoc on all generations. Short-form media is melting brains, people are betting the house in prediction markets and on memecoins, and health is deteriorating.

In the west, there is a revolution. 

There is some overlap between the halves, 

1. Fracture
	1. Steady pursuit of excellence over decades
	2. Substance
	3. Short form 

The middle doesn't exist
collective cultural consciousness is not fragmented by subcommunity. 

## Permanent Overclass

If you're in a good spot right now, it's self-sustaining
If you're not, it's self-destructive

## Shared Culture / Flattening

## Revolt
