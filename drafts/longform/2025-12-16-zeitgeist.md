# The Chalamet Schism

I've become increasingly convinced that there exists a widening chasm in the current zeitgeist. 

On one side -- the old world -- dopamine addiction and late stage capitalism are wreaking havoc on all generations. Short-form media continues to melt brains, people are betting the house in prediction markets and on memecoins, and health is deteriorating.

In the other, there is a revolution. The insurgents are abandoning the screens, demanding more of their media, and setting the foundations to build monuments. They are not Luddites, but of some new still not clearly defined culture of embodied... something. 

Timothee Chalamet is the most obvious face for this revolt, with his athletic mentality of success and greatness in a profession typically used to faux-humility. 

For the moment, there is still a bridge between the two lands, but I think once AI *fully* embeds itself into the digital landscape, it will crumble. 

## Permanent Overclass

There has been a lot of somewhat joking chatter online recently about having a small window to "escape the permanent underclass" financially. Might be true, but I think it's more interesting to think about it in the context of *this* fracture that extends beyond money. 

Both sides of this cultural divide are self-reinforcing(?). Brain melting begets brain melting and health begets health. The downward spiral and the upward spiral.

The real permanent "overclass" is the set of people who will maintain, reinforce, and grow their human capacities alongside the artificial powers. I'm still working out what will happen to the economy in a post-AGI world, but I would imagine that a similar feedback loop of capital will accrue to the in-group of this camp. 

You can basically flip these to get the qualities of the "underclass". 

If you're in a good spot right now, it's self-sustaining. If you're not, the self-destruction amplifies itself. 




The middle doesn't exist
collective cultural consciousness is not fragmented by subcommunity.

## Plans and Questions

As this is part of my daily blog series and I have a limited amount of time today, I'd like to use the remaining bit to describe an initial plan for going at this and the sets of questions that most enthrall me about this problem. 

### Step 1 - *Define* the End-State

Goal: Create a set of proxy tasks such that if an AI could complete them autonomously, we'd be in what I consider to be a meaningful end-state environment for this discussion. 

This gives us a stable "physics" to work within. 
### Step 2 - Kinematics

Goal: Define the important trajectories we want to map and how to define them.

Put plainly, if we have an agreed upon set of end-state capabilities, we need to define the industries/sectors/areas/ideas that we want to try unfolding under this physics.

Some candidates: public markets, resource ownership, human power dynamics, art, etc... 

### Step 3 - On Meaning/Identity

I think the core of this discussion (the elephant inside of the elephant) is going to break down to a question of *meaning*, so I'll have to spend some time on it. 

That's obviously a big one. I'll need to scope it

There are a lot of ways to cut this all up. Some potential lenses:
* "End-state is 0 necessary friction between idea and execution - explore *friction* as a meaning maker". 
* "End-state is never doing anything you don't want to do - explore *suffering* as a meaning maker". 
* "End-state is that all questions are answerable via inference - explore *exploration* and curiosity as a meaning maker"

I'm not sure... A bit at sea with this one, which makes sense given I'm asking a 10,000 year old question here. 

## Conclusion

My goal is simple: to have a vision for the future worth running towards that is equally vivid as the one we're running from. 

Some questions: 
1. What happens to the instinctive drive to create power dynamics in society?
2. What happens to social mobility?
	1. Permanent underclass? Real or fake! Who knows!
3. What happens to art without friction? 
	1. Where do our creative impulses come from?
4. Spirituality?
	1. Does religious practice increase? 
5. Access to AI?
6. What happens to finance and currency generally?
	1. Will there be any human participants in markets? 
7.
