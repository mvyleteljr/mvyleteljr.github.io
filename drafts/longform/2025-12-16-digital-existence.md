# *Motivations*

My goal in starting this series is to explore and develop my personal relationship to the digital. 

## Themes

**Coherence** and **health** have been two emerging themes in my thinking lately. 

> Coherence: The property of wholeness and logically consistency in a system

> Health: Positive self-sustenance and goal adherence

I've recently begun analyzing the environments and habits with which I find myself engaging under the lens of these two definitions to find ways I can contribute to a better life for myself and those around me. 

The basic hypothesis is that a more coherent and healthy reality will increase alignment, and that alignment creates a better life. Another simple framing is that an incoherent and unhealthy system is destructive, while a coherent and healthy one is constructive. 

One way to illustrate this is to think about coherence between internal and external self-definition: the distance between you are and who you say you are. Say you tell people you love to write but have not written anything substantial, or devoted much attention to the practice in months. This is an example of incoherence -- there is not logical consistency between the what you say and the things you do. In my experience, the end result of this fractured identity system is a gnawing sense of unease that bleeds out destructively as one seeks to avoid the external reality that disturbs the internal construction. 

It's also possible to have coherence without health. In the writing example, you may write often, but your practice is scattered and you're unsatisfied with the output for whatever reason. In this case, there is logical consistency between the internal and external, but the practice is unhealthy. It's not positively self-sustaining and does not achieve your goals. 

There is some relationship here to shadow integration, probably, but that's beyond the scope of this article.  

## Digital Coherence

One area where it's easy to fall into incoherent and unhealthy behaviors is in digital space. The platforms we interact with are sticky, and incentives are often misaligned between companies and their users. 

The same way there can be a rift between your internal self-definition and your external reality, there can be one between one's physical self and one's digital self. What's interesting with this rift, however, is that it is often *intentional*. There are many netizens who love the internet precisely because they can be substantially different online than they are offline.

In any event, there can still be coherence and health in this system. 

## Software Fundamentals

To start, I decided to create a taxonomy to create a map of the software I'll be exploring. Here are the categories I'm starting with:

* Information: Software for the purpose of *consuming* media or information
	* Examples: Social media, data dashboards, news sites, streaming services
	* Note: I group tools for *analyzing* information in this category for now
* Creation: Software for the purpose of *creating* media or information
	* Examples: Adobe Creative Cloud, Ableton, Google Docs
* Distribution: Software to distribute media or information, or to facilitate 1 to N
	* Examples: Social media, forums 
* Communication: Software to facilitate direct communication
	* iMessage, Signal, social media, 
* State Management
	* Finance apps
* Experience Generation
	* Games,

>AI will contribute to the world in many ways, but the gains to quality of life from AI driving faster scientific progress and increased productivity will be enormous; the future can be vastly better than the present. Scientific progress is the biggest driver of overall progress; it’s hugely exciting to think about how much more we could have.
