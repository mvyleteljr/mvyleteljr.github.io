# Intro

This is part 2 of my attempt to "Eat the Elephant", where I'm trying to make my own vivid picture of a post-AGI world. 

In this piece, I'm going after the leg, because it's close to the ground. 

## End-State Definition

I need a framework for understanding about AI capabilities post-AGI. Best I can imagine right now is to think through the question along two boundaries:
1. Cognitive Power: How much the model knows
2. Actuator Power: How much the model can touch

## Cognitive Boundary

The rough cognitive boundary definition is that *anything fundamentally derivable is derivable given sufficient data and compute*.

. Leaving Godel's Incompleteness Theorem out of scope for the moment, we already live in a space where enough compute and date would allow us to fundamentally derive any information. 

The classic example is a dice roll. Feels random, but if you know the exact launch angle, shape angle, molecular structure, etc... You would be able to calculate the outcome with 100% accuracy, assuming macro-level determinism. We're just limited on is data and compute. 

To make this operational, I'll scope the cognitive boundary to only cover *human-relevant* problems and include a dynamic rate variable (economically deployable compute growing at some rate $X$) that will give us some structure. 

Therefore, in the end-state, I'll assume we've crossed the boundary when *any human-relevant* problem is fundamentally derivable with an economically feasible level of compute. 




**I. Opening reframe** The capability itself isn't incomprehensible - it has a surprisingly clean shape. Two boundaries. What's incomprehensible lives downstream, in the dynamics. (This post: the container. Later posts: what happens inside it.)

**II. Cognitive boundary** _Definition:_ Anything fundamentally derivable given sufficient data and compute.

- Practical ceiling: effectively unbounded for human-relevant problems
- Rate variable: economically deployable compute, growing at [X]

**III. Actuator boundary** _Definition:_ Anything electrically addressable, directly or via one intermediary machine.

- Coverage variable: how much of world gets wired (infrastructure question, not intelligence question)

**IV. The interaction** (brief - sets up future posts) Actuator surface generates data → feeds cognition → finds new uses for actuators. Flywheel.
