I spend so much time ping ponging between two states. The first is the most normal "default" state in which I *want* for very little and aim to have a good life, in the most broad sense of that phrase, in a simple way. Life is "play" and it's simple and it's joyful and nothing is that serious or intense. 

I do not feel good when I *want* but I am incredibly motivated by big questions and by complexity. 

I think things are fascinating but thinking about what I want to *receive* and how to set myself up to receive it has this effect of narrowing me into an incomprehensibly uncomfortable contortion that I can't quite wriggle out of easily. 

Then the other state. The state that lights a fire under me. The one that keeps me up at night. It's a set of questions and of weight and importance. I'm shocked alive by the realization that this is all real and it's all happening and it's all very consequential. 

I don't know how to make sense of this yet or merge the two states or what to do about that generally. When I try to act from this place of intense expansion or inspiration, things get blocked. I still get so heavy and things just don't work right. Concrete ideas don't flow, emotional intuition does and I speak in watercolors. When I drop back into a place of "I have everything that I want, just relax and have fun!" things do start to happen, but I'm usually a bit bored by them and it doesn't feel that great. There are rare moments when dropping back into the state of relaxation creates something wonderful that extends beyond the boundary, but it's rare and broadly unreliable.

I keep saying things like "the truth is I don't give a shit about anything beyond my people and loving the world."

But that's not exactly true and it's also a bit reductive to think that way. There are framings to put around everything that make everything a bit clearer. For example, if I say something like "I love connecting to people" or whatever then why am I not constantly reaching out to people and getting perspectives and learning and networking or whatever???

And it's because the thing that's holding me back is that I'm using the wrong lens!! I still think the lens of greed and power and wealth and status is bad for me. But the lens of curiosity and fascinating people and consequence is really exciting. You could certainly make the claim that impact and power have this weird important relationship, and that's true, but so what man???

So the thing is somewhere in there I think. 

And I do want, but I want for process and for "being" and "giving" and "connecting" not "having". I trust that I will find a way to progress my life in the traditional sense and reframe to receive it. 

So what do I want to "be", "give", and "connect" to? 

I love the big questions. The intractable questions that give you degrees of freedom to play. I like coming in with strange perspectives and trying to grok the intuitive dynamics of things that aren't clearly definable. I like to play with the idea of human flourishing and music and say big dramatic things, but my problem is that I'm actually not taking these impulses seriously, and I'm not translating my emotional intuition and flair for the big questions into something. 

The truth is that I don't give a fuck at all about creating some cool high-value startup that makes a good chunk of change and puts me on some nice comfy trajectory. I want to get close to the big questions because they are fun and not because I give a fuck about any particular industry or technology or whatever but because I care about humans and I care about flourishing and I care about living a life full of truth from a place of truth and brushing up against something fundamental that puts me in contact with reality. 

FUCKKK it feels good!

I think I'm seeing a path emerge here. back to something like the interplay between peace calm love beauty truth and taking oneself seriously. serious but not serious. self  respect life respect things that matter and things that don't matter but holy fuck the coercion and the reason I feel like I'm working so hard to "fit into this existence and do the right thing" is because I'm doing the wrong thing man I'm trying to live a life that's not meant for me. I don't want a stable cute job that pays well and nice lil startups that make me sound sexy at cocktail parties I WANT TO BE IN CONTACT but from a place of divine peace and joy. 

that's the thing thats the core Yeah, that's that's the thing that I feel like I'm trying to approach and not doing an effective job of. It's like I come with these ideas that to get at these fundamental questions I have to adopt this sort of seriousness or this sort of mentality. And again, I just I keep running into this friction that narrows me, but I want to be expansive and I want to be calm and peaceful, all that shit.

The goal is to live a great life. I love to be inspired. I love when things have actual consequence that's what literally gets me hard dude that's where my vitality comes from. 

Concretely, this motivation is not going to last so what is there to do?

The motivation I get comes from people, complexity, structure, and tension. So the two degree nudge is to obsessively begin reaching out to people and building structure that gives space to ideas so that I have something to offer. 

The whole thing of "not caring about stuff" is actually bullshit. It's just that I don't care about the stuff i care about the thing the stuff affects. 


So concretely the aims are now actually extremely precise:
1. Take absolutely seriously the problem of health, energy, and clarity
2. Reframe what you want to do around what you want to "be", "give", "connect to"
3. Bring in people *constantly*
4. Sharpen the questions -- precision
5. Absolute honesty and simplicity
