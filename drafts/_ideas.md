## 2026-01-16: What does it mean to ask an LLM a question?

The framing itself is interesting. LLMs as predictive models, self-understanding, the gap between helpful-for-explicit-tasks and genuine thought partnership. Can't get them "fully activated" for net-new ideas — they're still bad thought partners. Is that a feature or a bug? Miss pre-LLM tangibility. Ambient intelligence feels weird. Central curiosity: how to get the most out of current models.
