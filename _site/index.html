                <h3>Career Story</h3>
                <p>
                    After graduating in 2020, I worked part-time as a data
                    engineer before becoming interested in crypto through NFTs.
                    I was excited about NFTs as a way to give provenance to
                    digital artists, and to experiment with new financialization
                    models that could free these artists from the tyranny of
                    traditional structures that often exploited them with
                    abusive contracts. To that end, I joined an early-stage
                    startup as the lead backend engineer building infrastructure
                    to support and experiment with NFT curation and
                    marketplaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Towards the middle of 2023, I found myself jaded to the
                    crypto industry, and gave myself a "gap year" to explore
                    other interests before making my next career move. The NFT
                    sector had devolved (predictably) into a pure
                    hyper-financialized speculation game, artists were rarely
                    supported in the ways I had hoped, and no truly innovative
                    business models had emerged to ground the hype. I left my
                    job in June 2023 and began my mini-sabbatical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spent the rest of the year and the first half of 2024
                    mostly exploring creative and personal interests, including
                    music, visual art, writing, and deepening my contemplative
                    practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of this hiatus, I decided to give crypto a second
                    chance, but from a different angle that I hoped would help
                    me develop a holistic yet technical perspective. I joined a
                    leading crypto-focused venture capital firm as a technical
                    infrastructure analyst, focusing on research and deal
                    diligence for blockchain infrastructure projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the crypto-AI relationship began to mature by the end of
                    2024, and with no one else on the team specifically focused
                    on AI, I decided to add it to my responsibilities and began
                    leading much of the AI research at 1kx. I found myself
                    becoming increasingly enamored with AI, and correspondingly
                    less interested in crypto, so I joined two colleagues who
                    were similarly ready to leave the blockchain industry, and
                    together we founded Concordance, where we explore the
                    burgeoning niche of applied mechanistic interpretability.
