## Introduction

Most of the deeper technical writing will eventually be housed in the Concordance blog. This blog will be for smaller posts and learnings.

I expect there to be a healthy balance of "external" and "internal" content, with a focus on sharing knowledge.

I will populate this orientation post with my favorite posts as they come up. For now, there is no more to see here :)
