tldr: A minimal Markdown-powered blog with ordered posts.

This site now supports Markdown posts. Drop files into `_posts/` using the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.

Images can be referenced by absolute paths (recommended), for example:

![Favicon example](/assets/favicon.jpg)

Embedded videos can be included via raw HTML, for example:

<!--
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
-->

Tip: store post-specific images under `assets/blog/<slug>/...` and link them as `/assets/blog/<slug>/file.png`.
